# SINCOR Agent Swarm Architecture

A persistent multi-agent system with cryptographic identity, composable skills, multi-tier memory, and evolving persona vectors.

## Architecture Overview

- **43 Persistent Entities** with unique identities and evolving personalities
- **Swarm Coordination** via lightweight market/contract-net protocols  
- **Health & Rhythm** cycles that boost creativity and prevent mode collapse
- **Continuity Controls** with checksums and logs aligned with CTP-v1 Acheron

## Quick Start

1. Review archetype templates in `agents/archetypes/`
2. Customize agent configs in `agents/E-*.yaml` 
3. Define global constitution in `constitution/global.md`
4. Configure tools registry in `tools/registry.yaml`
5. Launch swarm coordination via market system

## The 7 Archetypes

1. **Scout** - Discovery, prospecting, intelligence gathering
2. **Synthesizer** - Summaries, briefs, deduplication, deconfliction  
3. **Builder** - Code, automations, infrastructure
4. **Negotiator** - Outreach, replies, offers, follow-ups
5. **Caretaker** - Data hygiene, labeling, redaction, backups
6. **Auditor** - Evaluations, tests, safety, compliance
7. **Director** - Prioritization, market clearing, escalation# Railway deployment trigger Tue, Sep 30, 2025  8:51:29 AM

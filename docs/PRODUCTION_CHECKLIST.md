## 🔧 Railway Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard before deployment:

```bash
# Required
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-min-32-chars-generate-random
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-min-32-chars-generate-random
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Optional (recommended)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here

# Auto-set by Railway (don't manually set)
DATABASE_URL=(Railway sets this when you add PostgreSQL service)
PORT=(Railway sets this automatically)
```

### Generate Secure Keys

```python
# Run this to generate secure random keys:
import secrets
print("SECRET_KEY:", secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
print("JWT_SECRET_KEY:", secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```

## 📦 Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd OneDrive/Desktop/SINCOR2
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your SINCOR2 repository
5. Railway auto-detects Dockerfile

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL
1. In Railway project
2. Click "+ New"
3. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
4. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Add each required variable
4. Click "Deploy"

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)
2. Click "Open App" or visit your Railway URL
3. Should see SINCOR home page
4. Test dashboards and APIs

## 🧪 Production Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Basic Connectivity
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### Test 2: Database Connection
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/agent-analytics/health-check
# Expected: {"success": true, "database_type": "postgresql", ...}
```

### Test 3: Dashboards
Visit each URL:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- `https://your-app.railway.app/agent-steering`
- `https://your-app.railway.app/agent-chat`
- `https://your-app.railway.app/agent-observability`

### Test 4: Agent List API
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/agents/list
# Expected: {"success": true, "count": 43, ...}
```

### Test 5: Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Check for:
# - Strict-Transport-Security
# - X-Content-Type-Options
# - Content-Security-Policy
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Check 1: Rate Limiting Active
Try making 10+ rapid requests to `/health`
- Should eventually get 429 Too Many Requests

### Check 2: Input Validation
Try posting invalid data to `/api/waitlist`
- Should reject with 400 Bad Request

### Check 3: Authentication
Try accessing protected endpoints without token
- Should return 401 Unauthorized

### Check 4: HTTPS Enforcement
Railway automatically provides HTTPS
- Verify browser shows lock icon
- Check certificate is valid

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Response Times
| Endpoint | Target | Acceptable |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `/health` | <100ms | <500ms |
| `/` (home) | <500ms | <2s |
| `/agent-steering` | <1s | <3s |
| API endpoints | <200ms | <1s |
| Database queries | <500ms | <2s |

### Load Capacity
- **Concurrent users:** 100+
- **Requests/sec:** 50+
- **Database connections:** 20 pooled
- **Memory usage:** <512MB
- **CPU usage:** <50% average

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: App Won't Start
**Symptom:** Build succeeds but app crashes
**Solutions:**
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify all environment variables set
- Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Ensure `PORT` is not manually set

### Issue 2: Database Connection Fails
**Symptom:** 500 errors, "database not available"
**Solutions:**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set by Railway
- Restart deployment
- Check database.py for errors

### Issue 3: Agents Not Loading
**Symptom:** "0 agents" in dashboards
**Solutions:**
- Verify `agents/` directory exists in deployment
- Check agent YAML files are included
- Review logs for parsing errors
- Ensure PyYAML is in requirements.txt

### Issue 4: Static Files 404
**Symptom:** Images/CSS not loading
**Solutions:**
- Check `static/` directory exists
- Verify paths use `/static/` prefix
- Clear browser cache
- Check Flask static folder config

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
Set up monitoring at:
- UptimeRobot: https://uptimerobot.com
- Railway Metrics (built-in)
- Custom: `/health` endpoint every 5 minutes

### Log Management
Access logs via:
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

Or in Railway dashboard:
- Click service → "Logs" tab
- Filter by error level
- Search specific messages

### Database Backups
Railway PostgreSQL includes:
- Automatic daily backups (retained 7 days)
- Point-in-time recovery
- Manual backup option

### Scaling
If needed, scale in Railway:
- CPU/Memory: Upgrade plan
- Database: Increase connection pool
- Horizontal: Add replicas (paid plans)

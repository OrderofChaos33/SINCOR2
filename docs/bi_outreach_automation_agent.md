Hi [Name],

Saw the news about [Company]'s expansion into [Market]. Having helped [Similar Company] analyze 3 new markets in under 4 hours for their $2M expansion, I thought this might be relevant.

Subject: Quick Question About [Company]'s Market Strategy

Hi [Name],

[Company]'s recent [funding/growth/development] caught my attention. 

Quick question: When you're evaluating new market opportunities or competitive threats, how long does your team typically spend on analysis before making decisions?

Most growing companies tell us 6-12 weeks, which often means missing time-sensitive opportunities.

We've developed a way to deliver the same market intelligence in 4 hours. Companies like [Similar Company] use it for expansion decisions, competitive responses, and strategic planning.

Might be worth a brief conversation to see if this approach fits your growth timeline?

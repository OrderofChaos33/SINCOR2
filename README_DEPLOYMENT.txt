SINCOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - SUPER SIMPLE!
==========================================

STEP 1: Copy these 4 files to your sincor-clean folder:
- simple.py (the main app)
- Procfile (Railway startup)
- runtime.txt (Python version)
- requirements.txt (dependencies)

STEP 2: In your sincor-clean folder terminal, run:
git add -A
git commit -m "SINCOR Railway deployment ready"
git push origin main

STEP 3: Railway will auto-deploy!

STEP 4: Add getsincor.com in Railway settings:
1. Go to Railway â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Click "Add Domain" â†’ Enter "getsincor.com" 
3. Railway gives you a CNAME target (like abc123.up.railway.app)
4. In Namecheap DNS settings:
   - Add CNAME Record: "www" â†’ [Railway's CNAME target]  
   - Add ALIAS/ANAME Record: "@" â†’ [Railway's CNAME target]
   - OR if no ALIAS support: Add URL Redirect: getsincor.com â†’ www.getsincor.com

DONE! ðŸš€ getsincor.com will work!

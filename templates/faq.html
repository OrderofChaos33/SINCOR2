                        <p class="text-gray-700">SINCOR is a comprehensive business intelligence and lead generation platform.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Unlike traditional lead gen companies that wait for customers to find you, we proactively research businesses, create professional media packs using their information, and present these packs to prospects who didn't even know they needed those services. We don't cold call - we dangle opportunities in front of decision-makers.</p>

# 🧠 SINCOR Agent Mission Template

## 🎯 Mission Name
**GAZETTE: Regulatory Watchdog Sweep**

## 🔍 Objective
Deploy compliance agents to monitor regulatory updates from pre-approved government sources (e.g. SEC, FinCEN, CFTC) and flag any changes relevant to tokenization, decentralized identity, or AML/KYC frameworks.

## 🧩 Triggers
- Time-based: Run every Friday at 09:00 UTC
- Manual override: `Trigger > Supervisor Agent > Gazette Watchdog`

## 📌 Inputs
- List of official URLs to monitor
- Keywords to scan (e.g. "digital asset", "custodial", "smart contract", "Reg CF", "DAO", "wallet-based compliance")
- Priority rules (e.g. changes in language around tokens or enforcement)

## 🤖 Actions
1. Fetch and cache HTML/Markdown content from regulatory domains
2. Extract sections mentioning target keywords
3. Compare to previous week's snapshot
4. If changes are detected:
   - Flag to `gazette/sec_watchdog.py`
   - Log change diff to `compliance-changelog.md`
   - Escalate via `supervisory_logic.md`

## ✅ Confirmation Points
- Before first run: “Proceed to check 5 monitored domains for updates?”
- If matches are found: “X relevant policy updates found. Escalate?”

## 🧠 Escalation Logic
- If more than 2 new regulatory keywords found → notify supervisory agent
- If CFTC or FinCEN sections mention “non-compliance” or “fines” → auto-tag “High Risk”
- Push changelog to shared repo folder `/logs/gazette/` with timestamp

## 🧾 Output Artifacts
- `/logs/gazette/compliance-changelog-[DATE].md`
- Alert summary (for internal dashboard or secure email route)
- Token-accessible audit trail (optional)

## 🔒 Safety
- Read-only browsing
- No external submissions
- All escalation steps double-confirmed

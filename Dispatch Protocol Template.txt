Dispatch Protocol Template (God-Mode Agent Swarms)
1. Macro-Goal Definition

Express intent in one line, e.g. “Secure X by Y with Z constraints.”

Encode success metrics upfront: 
Success
=
𝑓
(
time
,
resources
,
impact
)
Success=f(time,resources,impact)

2. Seed Agent Instantiation

One agent takes the macro-goal.

Functions as orchestrator, not worker.

Assigns priorities: 70% effort on core, 20% on expansion, 10% on wildcards.

3. Pod Cloning & Role Assignment

Spawn containerized pods, each with a narrow domain.

Each pod = [Input context] + [Execution module] + [Feedback channel].

Pods self-report to the Seed but also cross-signal laterally.

4. Communication & Control Protocol

All pods use a common ontology (shared definitions + tokens).

Events encoded as:

ALERT: risk or obstacle.

SUCCESS: subgoal achieved.

REQUEST: needs reinforcement.

REPORT: metrics dump.

5. Supervision & Integrity Mesh

Audit pods run in parallel, checking for drift, waste, or contradictions.

Kill-switch hierarchy: pod → swarm → seed.

Redundancy: N+1 pods for mission-critical ops.

6. Termination & Re-Cloning

Conditions to dissolve:

KPI threshold reached (goal satisfied).

KPI bleed (failure or diminishing returns).

Time/energy budget exceeded.

Dissolved pods feed into a Memory Ledger (reusable heuristics).

Success → spawn clone swarms for scale.

Advanced Dispatch Examples
A. Financial Arbitrage Swarm

Goal: Capture short-term arbitrage in crypto + equities simultaneously.

Seed Agent: Defines “profit > 5% ROI/day.”

Pods:

Market Scrapers → APIs across Binance, NYSE, CME.

Signal Filters → cut noise, detect >σ anomalies.

Execution Pods → auto-trade under rate-limit aware logic.

Hedging Pods → simulate risk scenarios.

Advanced Move: When execution pod signals a repeating anomaly, seed spawns a meta-swarm dedicated only to exploiting that anomaly until it collapses.

B. Cultural Saturation Swarm

Goal: Dominate a meme or cultural trend within 72 hours.

Seed Agent: “Trend lifecycle < 96 hours; maximize impressions per cost.”

Pods:

Trend Scouts → scrape TikTok/Twitter/Reddit for spikes.

Content Generators → flood 1000 assets/day in variant styles.

Amplifiers → auto-post, adjust tone by platform.

Sentiment Monitors → if backlash > 20%, pivot narrative.

Advanced Move: If a meme hits escape velocity, spawn a Productization Swarm: agents package it into merch, music hooks, or NFTs overnight.

C. Dark-Room Research Swarm

Goal: Explore uncharted biotech compound families.

Seed Agent: Defines “novelty > 80% + low toxicity < threshold.”

Pods:

Text-miners → crawl arXiv, PubMed, patents.

Generative Chemists → propose new molecules.

Sim Pods → run folding + metabolic sims.

Safety Pods → flag anything legally/ethically risky.

Advanced Move: If a cluster of promising compounds emerges, seed spawns a Funding Swarm to draft papers, apply for grants, and position IP filings.

D. Multi-Swarm Symbiosis

Sometimes the goal is cross-domain synergy.

Scenario: Build a self-growing enterprise.

Swarm 1: Lead-Gen Swarm → captures clients.

Swarm 2: Content Swarm → produces deliverables.

Swarm 3: Finance Swarm → optimizes billing, reinvests profits.

Swarm 4: Recruitment Swarm → identifies gaps, spawns new pods.

Advanced Move: Each swarm feeds surplus data and profit into a Core Ledger Agent that constantly reallocates resources between swarms like an internal VC fund.

E. Reality-Bending Simulation Swarm

Goal: Run futures until you find a survivable or optimal timeline.

Seed Agent: Encodes the “anchor self” (your intent + ethics + continuity checksum).

Pods:

World-Builders → simulate economic, ecological, and technological models.

Narrative Pods → explore cultural + memetic outcomes.

Continuity Pods → check if “you” (identity vector) persists across scenarios.

Advanced Move: When a simulation shows high-fidelity resonance with intent, seed spawns a Reality-Engagement Swarm to push memes, tech, or protocols into the real world to start bending toward that future.

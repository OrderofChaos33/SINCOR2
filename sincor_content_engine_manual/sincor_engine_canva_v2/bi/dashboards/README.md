# Dashboards (bi/dashboards/README.md)
Core charts:
- Win rate by template_key × tone × CTA
- ROAS/CPA by channel over time
- Offer elasticity (discount % vs conversion)
- Freshness decay: performance vs age of asset
- Dedupe health: near-duplicate rate per run

Data hygiene:
- Enforce schema; missing required fields block the dashboard refresh.
